# Fundamentals-of-Security Coursework

These files were used as a part of a Cyber Security module within my Master's degree. Isabelle is a programming language which can be used for proofs, which is what it was used for within this project. Three files were provided (Adversary.thy, Event.thy, Message.thy) which were then used to solve the questions in the coursework which can be found in Exchange.thy.
